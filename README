The goal of this homework is to become familiar with using shared memory and creating multiple processes.
We have to make two executable oss.o and worker.o The first executable file, oss, will be in charge of
launching a specific number of child processes at various times using a fork followed by an exec. oss should then
keep track of how many children have finished executing and terminate itself only when all of its children have
finished.
The task in the child executable worker.o will be given a command line
argument when they were execed off, this should be the value of m. Then they should try and increment the value
of the clock in shared memory by that value multiplied by a million.Each child should also print to the screen 
during each iteration of the loop a message specifying their PID and whichincrement they are doing.

Challenges faced :
1. I was able to create a makefile that compiles two source files 
2. In oss.c I tried to allocate shared memory, use it, then deallocate it but I was facing getting some errors. 
3. Then in oss I tried to used fork off and exec one child and have that child attach to shared memory and read the clock and
output the result. Was getting errors.
4. Tried using signal handling to terminate after 2 seconds.
5. Create the code to fork off a fixed number of processes but was getting errors.
6. Lastly tried setting up code to fork off child processes until the specific limits.

PLEASE NOTE: I do not have any experience in C and purely due to lack of such experience, I was not able to fully write the code as mentioned for 
oss.c and worker.c 
I went through the codes provided on Canvas and when it comes to implemetation in Project 2 I was getting a lot of errors which
I couldn't fix. I tried reading and looking into videos and tutorials that would help me, but that was not of much help for Project 2 
I really tried working hard on this project and despite having started early, this was all I could realistically do given the timeframe.

I would really appreciate it if project related exercises, tutorials and examples are provided and demonstrated in class to help me 
learn coding/developing programs that are required in completing the projects for this course.
